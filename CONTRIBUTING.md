## Preparation

Before starting work on a new bug, feature, etc. ensure that an [issue](https://github.com/machine/machine.specifications/issues) has been raised. Indicate your intention to work on the issue by writing a comment against it. This will prevent duplication of effort. If the issue is a new feature, it's usually best to propose a design in the issue comments.
